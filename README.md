## 26th May 2023
Teams projects presentation. 
The presentation has 2 goals : 
1. Improve the performance of the basic shallow network (1.One Hidden Layer with Tensorflow.ipynb) and briefly showing the obtained results. 
    This task has the 20% of impact on the project 
3. Improve the performance of the basic deep neural netwok (2.Deep ANN with tanh and Keras.ipynb) and explain results and attempts. 
    This task has the 80% of impact on the project 
    
Each group will provide a power point presentation about the the work that has been done. 
Each group will have a slot of 10 minutes to present their results. 
Each team member will have the chance to present.
